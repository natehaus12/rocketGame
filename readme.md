# Overview

I made a game using python and pygame. This hepled me learn to work with different moving parts
and understand how to make a simple game.

I made a rocket game. There are rockets launched from the left side of the screen and a shield on the right side than can move up or down. You must block the rockets with the sheild using the arrow up and down keys before the rockets hit the right side of the screen.

# Development Environment

I used VS code to write this program.

I wrote this in python. I needed the pygame library, pygame locals, the time library, the random library, and the math library.

I did a tutorial on the snake game to learn the basics of pygame before I made my own game.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Generate multiple rockets at once.
* Stop the lag in the sheild
* Add something other than a rocket you need to avoid.
